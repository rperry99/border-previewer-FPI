## Border Radius Previewer

This project lets a user visually play with the border radius of a rectangle. The user can create different weird shapes with this tool. They can also copy the CSS to use in their own projects.
Something new I learned doing this project was how to have the user copy something with a viusal button on the screen instead of the normal "Highlight and CTRL+C".
